## Part 2: UI project

> You can find the solution for this exercise  in the `task-ui` directory.

Using the **Test Server** write a user interface that renders a **grid** of transactions.

### Requirements

* Write a react component that takes an `Array` of **transactions** and render it as a table. The
table must have headers for each column.
* Using the library from the previous task, add a **search** functionality to the table to allow
users to search over the `name` field of the transactions list.
* Using the library from the previous task, add a **sort** functionality to the table to allow users
to sort over the `amount` field of the transactions list.
* Write a react application that fetches a list of **transactions** from the test server described
below and uses the component from the previous point to render the list of **transactions**

### Acceptance criteria

* Your project must have unit tests.
* Your project must have a README.md file that explains how to build it, run the tests and explains
how test your project in a browser.
